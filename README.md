This project consists of a calculator developed in Python, capable of performing basic and advanced arithmetic operations. The user interface was implemented using the Tkinter library to provide an interactive and friendly experience. Also, the calculator was designed to be responsive, adapting efficiently to different fabric sizes.

## Features
Basic operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations between real numbers.
Advanced operations: square roots
Responsive user interface: The graphical interface provided by Tkinter was designed to adapt to different fabric sizes, offering an ideal experience both on tabletop devices and on mobile devices.

## Used technology
Python: The project was developed in Python, a high-level and versatile programming language.
Tkinter: The Tkinter library was used to create the graphical user interface.
Math: The Python Math library was used to perform advanced mathematical operations.
